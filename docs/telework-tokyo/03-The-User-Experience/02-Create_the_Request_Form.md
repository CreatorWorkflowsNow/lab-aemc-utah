# Create the Request Form

## Purpose

ServiceNow offers multiple ways to create a user experience for submitting a form. In this exercise, we will learn one quick way to get users off paper forms and emails.

1. Go to App Home tab, "App home Telework"



2. On the application homepage, locate the **Experience** section and click the **‚®Å Add icon**
 ![relative](../Click_Add_Experience.png)

    This takes us to a selection where we can identify the type of experience we wish to create.

3. **Select** the **Record Producer** option.

    :::info

    A record producer is a specific type of catalog item that allows end users to create task-based records from the service catalog.

    :::


4. This launches the record producer creator.

5. Click on the <span className="aes_button">Begin</span> button

6. Set the following values (üí° double-click, copy & paste into the form)

    Field Name                | Field Value
    --------------------------| --------------
    **(1)** Name              | Apply for Telework
    **(2)** Short Description | Use this form to apply for Telework

    **(3)** Click on the <span className="aes_button">Continue</span> button

14. Let's add questions to the form

    :::info
    Unlike in a paper-based form, we don't need to ask users to fill personal information like first name, last name, ‚Ä¶, or date of request. That information will be automatically attached to the case. This makes filling forms so much faster.
    :::

15. We want to allow users to open a case on behalf of another individual, so let's start by asking users " **Who is this request for?**" and " **When do you need this?"**

16. **Click** on Questions

17. **Click the arrow next to** Insert new questionthen click "Question set"

 ![relative](./user_form/Click_Insert_new_question.png)

18. Select "Standard Employee Questions" and click Submit

 ![relative](./user_form/Select_Standard_Employee_Questions.png)

    This will add two frequently asked questions on forms

19. One key information we need users to provide is the type of arrangement they are applying for.
    1. Click Insert new question
    2. For Question type, select **Choice**
    3. For **Question subtype** , select **Record reference**

**Exercise Recap**

In this exercise, we learned how to use App Engine Studio (AES) to easily create customized Catalog Items that users can access in Service Portal and on mobile devices.

Our next exercise will focus on taking the building blocks created to this point and making them actionable to drive automation and process optimization
