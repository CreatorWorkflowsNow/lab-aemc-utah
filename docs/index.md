## Collaborate to Accelerate

### Revolutionizing Enterprise App Dev at Scale

*Formerly known as the Low-Code Governance Workshop Lab*

In this lab, we embark on a journey to elevate the landscape of enterprise application development. Our focus is on revolutionizing the way applications are crafted on the ServiceNow Platform, empowered by the capabilities of the App Engine Management Center.

Through seamless collaboration among pro-code, low-code, and no-code developers within a unified platform, we unlock the potential to expedite the entire development lifecycle.
