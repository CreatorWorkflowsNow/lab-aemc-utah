| Jayne Nigel| App Engine Admin
|--|--|
| ![](../assets/images/2023-03-28-16-42-23.png) | Jayne is familiar with many different software methodologies such as Agile and SAFe. She is familiar with Update Sets from her ServiceNow training, but she does not regularly work with them.

In this section, our **App Engine Admin** Jayne will review and approve Sydney's App Intake request. 

When Sydney submitted her Intake Request it triggered an email to Jayne to let her know to take action. 

Here is a sample of what the email would look like in real life:

The Prod instance will configure Sydney's App Engine User access on the Dev environment.
 
In the real world, there might be more than one person to do the approval and more time may be taken to review the answers.
 
You may also want to require the person to undergo additional training before approving their access to build applications. 

## Lessons Learned

During our journey through the 'Intake - Approval' process, several insightful takeaways emerged, all of which can prove helpful for future reference:

1. **Role Clarification**: The process shed light on the critical role that Jayne, the App Engine Admin, plays within the system. Her duties, while not labeled 'Platform Administrator' or assigned any 'admin' roles in any environment, are far-reaching. Her approvals initiate a sequence of automated procedures that are crucial for the smooth functioning of the system. This serves as a reminder that all roles, regardless of their titles, have significant responsibilities and impacts.

2. **Approval Process**: The impact of the approval process on subsequent actions (like triggering an automated email to Sydney) was an essential takeaway. This demonstrates the power of automated workflows in saving time and reducing manual errors.

3. **Segregation of Duties**: Successfully completing this process without Jayne needing an 'admin' role showcases the 'Segregation of Duties' principle. It illustrates that high-level access (like the 'admin' role) isn't always required to complete significant tasks. This reduces potential security risks and promotes system integrity.
