Below are some tips and tricks that you may find useful in the lab today.

There are several times in the exercises where you will need to copy and paste values. 

To make this easier, we have added a clipboard icon to the end of the fields to automatically copy to your clipboard for you.

Copy me!
```

<input type="text" name="paste" placeholder="Paste here!"/>

You MUST use the values provided as that is the password that is already set for that account. 

If you do not use the provided username and password, you will get the following error:
