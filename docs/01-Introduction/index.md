## Collaborate to Accelerate

### *Revolutionizing Enterprise App Dev at Scale*


In this lab, we will review how to govern App Engine development on the ServiceNow Platform using App Engine Management
 Center. 

The Lab is split into two main sections:

- **Implementation**
  - One-time activities completed when installing and configuring App Engine for the first time. 

- **Simulation**
  - Impersonate App Engine personas to understand how App Engine is used by each.
