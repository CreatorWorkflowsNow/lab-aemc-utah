# Collaborate to Accelerate

**Revolutionizing Enterprise App Dev at Scale**

*Formerly known as the Low-Code Governance Workshop Lab*

In this lab, we embark on a journey to elevate the landscape of enterprise application development. Our focus is on revolutionizing the way applications are crafted on the ServiceNow Platform, empowered by the capabilities of the App Engine Management Center.

Through seamless collaboration among pro-code, low-code, and no-code developers within a unified platform, we unlock the potential to expedite the entire development lifecycle.

## Lab Structure

### Implementation

During this phase, we establish the bedrock by setting up and configuring the App Engine. These activities are conducted as one-time essentials, laying the foundation for an enriched development experience.

### Simulation

Step into the shoes of various App Engine personas to gain comprehensive insights into how this dynamic tool is leveraged by different roles. This immersive experience enhances your understanding of the platform's versatility.

Embark on this transformative journey as we reshape enterprise app development, foster synergy, and empower innovation.

Your commitment to innovation begins here.
