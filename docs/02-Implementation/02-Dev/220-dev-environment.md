# Create Controller Environment

import TimeEstimate from '@site/src/components/TimeEstimate';

<TimeEstimate>Estimated Time to Complete: 10 minutes</TimeEstimate>

## Overview

Production is considered the "Controller" Environment as that is where App Engine Management Center is installed and orchestrates activities from. 

Next up, you add an Environment record to your Dev instance containing the details for your Prod instance. 

### Before
``` mermaid
graph LR
    Dev[Development Instance]
    style Dev fill:#D5F7FF
```


### After

``` mermaid
graph 
    subgraph Development[Development Instance]
        Prod("#quot; AEMC Controller #quot;
        Environment record
        (Prod)")
    end
    class Development devStyle
    class Dev envStyle
    classDef devStyle fill:#D5F7FF;
    classDef envStyle fill:#F3F3F3;
```

## Lessons Learned

Throughout this exercise, we have gleaned important insights that can guide future procedures:

1. **Importance of the Controller Environment**: Setting up the Controller Environment is crucial for the operation of the App Engine Management Center. This exercise emphasizes the vital role of the Production instance, as it's where AEMC is installed and from where it orchestrates activities.

2. **Need for Accuracy**: The necessity of accurate input, especially when entering the Instance URL and designating the Controller, underlines the importance of attention to detail when setting up environments. One incorrect entry can hinder the functionality of the entire system.

3. **Validation Process**: The validation process ensures that the environment setup is correct and functional. The success message serves as confirmation that the system is correctly configured, reducing the potential for future issues.
